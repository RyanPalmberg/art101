	<div> <h3>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving<h3>
	</div>
	<div> <h1>Challenge<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> The main challenge when creating this lab was figuring out what we were going to make. The instructions
			<b1> were pretty open-ended, and we had trouble wrapping our heads around formatting our ideas to get the
				<b2> desired outcome. We managed, however.
	</p></h2></div>
	<div> <h1>Problems<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> We didn't run into too many issues while working. The biggest issue was really just knowing when to stop.
			<b1> I myself am not sure if the current pseudocode written for the word search is ample for this
				<b2> assignment. I do have confidence in the effort I put in, however, as well as my partner's.
	</p></h2></div>
	<div> <h1>Results<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> Overall, I'm satisfied with the end result. This isn't much of a project as it is a rough draft, so I
			<b1> think that the work done here is a good enough baseline for the what comes next. Props to my
				<b2> partner for understanding the assignment. I really struggled to get started.

	<div> <h1>Making a YouTube Video<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> 1. Create a Google account and Youtube account </p>
		<p> 2. Set up your environment </p>
		<p> 3. Set up the camera </p>
		<p> 4. Collect the footage you need </p>
		<p> 5. Upload the footage to a computer </p>
		<p> 6. Import the footage into your video editing software </p>
		<p> 7. Edit the video by cutting footage up and adding sound </p>
		<p> 8. Export the finished product </p>
		<p> 9. Go to YouTube and upload the video </p>
		<p> 10. Give a description and other fields of info </p>
		<p> 11. Publish the video </p>

	<div> <h1>Creating a Word Search<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> 1. Print a board with a distinct number of randomized letters </p>
		<p> 2. Print a “word list” for the user </p>
		<p> 3. Randomly insert words from the list horizontally, vertically, and diagonally </p>
		<p> 4. Accept user input </p>
		<p> 5. Validate user move </p>
		<p> 6. Draw a line through words on the board and on “word list” </p>
		<p> 7. Show “complete” and play confetti animation over the board when all words from list are crossed </p>

	<div> <h1>Current Pseudocode</h1>
		<pre><code>
// Creating a word search game:
  // Print a board with a distinct number of randomized letters
    // Create a 12x12 grid
  // Print a “word list” for the user
    // Make a list of 6 randomized words from a pre-written word bank
  // Randomly insert words from the list horizontally, vertically, and diagonally
    // In the remaining spaces, fill each with a randomized letter
  // Accept user input
  // Validate user move
    // Allow the user to use their mouse to interact with the page
  // Draw a line through words on the board and on “word list”
    // Allow use of the mosue to draw a line
      // Line locked to 8 cardinal directions
      // Whichever cells the line touches are considered part of the attempt
        // If the letters selected match correctly, then answer is validated
    // Repeat for all words
  // Show “complete” and play confetti animation over the board when all words from list are crossed
