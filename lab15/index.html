  <h3>Lab 15 - AJAX<h3>
  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The challenge of this lab was to make a code that could access and display information from an opensource API..</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The biggest problem I encountered in this lab was finding an accessible API link. There were dozens of API links out there, but many of them were locked or just didn't exist anymore. I had to find a website with free links to make any progress.</p>
    </h2>

    <h2>
      <p> I am very pleased with these results. Give the button a try :)</p>
