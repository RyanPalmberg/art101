  <h3>Lab 13 - Loops<h3>
  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The goal of this lab was to make a js file that would loop through the numbers 1 to 200 and check if each is divisible by 3, 5, or 7. if so, a string would be printed next to each number.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> My main issue came from formatting this assignment. It was difficult to figure out how to get the output on the page out of a paragraph format. The solution ended up being the opposite of wwhat I expected. By declaring each individual string as its own paragraph, I was able to give each one its own line.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> I'm more or less pleased with these results. I don't see anything wrong with my output, so I am free of anxiety in that department. However, the difficulties I had with formatting have made me question how much of the HTML langugae I really know. Only practice will tell.</p>
