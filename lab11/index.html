  <h3>Lab 11 - Libraries and jQuery<h3>

  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <button class="button1">Big Blue Button</button>
    <div id="challengetarget" class="smol">
      The challenge of this lab was to create multiple elements on the html page that have properties which can be toggled with the click of a button.
    </div>


  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <button class="button2">Fancy Button</button>
    <div id="challengetarget2" class="boring">
      The concept of this one was really hard to wrap my head around. It mostly boiled down to how the toggle function reads the selected properties fom my css file. Depending on if different classes held the same properties, it was difficult to get the button to work. Other than that it was hard to keep track of all of the classes and id's used.
    </div>


  <h1>Results</h1>
    <button class="button3">Shrink Button</button>
    <div id="challengetarget3" class="eh">
      I think the results turned out as they should. Nothing too exciting, but perfectly functional. I'd say that this was the hardest lab yet.
