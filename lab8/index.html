  <h3>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks<h3>

  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The main challenge of this lab was to create multiple functions that performed specified operations on numbers that were fed to them. An array then had to be made that used the map() function to push all of its values through the written functions. The results would then appear in the browser's console. </p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The biggest problem I encountered in this lab was Task X. Though I understand it is not required, it was still a bit discouraging to not figure it out. I couldn't parse the errors it gave me and even though my partner and I had similar code, I couldn't get it to work as he did.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The results are satisfactory overall. This was one of the more challenging labs, even without Task X. Seeing the results in the console was pretty cool. I learned some more operators for javascript and that has left me overall content with this lab.</p>
