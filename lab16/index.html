  <h3>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs<h3>
  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The challenge of this lab was to access the API provided and use its object attributes to display different things on my page..</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> I found that downloading the CORS plugin really helped wit the initial barrier. Aside from that, I didn't quite get what was meant by "attributes." I opted to just put the information below the image.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> I'm not very proud of this lab. Maybe it's because I've been busy, but this lab didn't make much sense to me. Maybe a bit of a low note for the last lab, but I think I've overall done well with them all.</p>
