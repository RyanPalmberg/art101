	</div>
	<div> <h1>Challenge</h1>
		<h2>
			<p> The main challenge of this lab was to implement both an array and an object into my JavaScript file and have it display the written information on my html.</p>
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div> <h1>Problems</h1>
		<h2>
			<p> The biggest problem I encountered in this lab was remembering how arrays and objects were structured. The instructions didn't provide much in this regard, so I went strictly off of memory.</p>
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div> <h1>Results</h1>
		<h2>
			<p> The results came exactly as expected. The instructions were more rigid this time around, and I feel like that helped to make the process of understanding and implementing the new material easier. I think it looks good overall, though I still have yet to create my global css file.</p>
