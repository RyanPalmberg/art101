	<div> <h1>Challenge<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> There was relatively little pushback with this lab. The only challenge there
			<b1> really was lied in understanding the material, which we were both decently
				<b2> experienced in.
	</p></h2></div>
	<div> <h1>Problems<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> I myself encountered no problems this time around. My partner's browser
			<b1> wasn't properly reading his files at first, but it was fixed will
				<b2> relative ease.
	</p></h2></div>
	<div> <h1>Results<h1>
	<h2>
		<p> I'm rather pleased with the results. I love this model of car and I think I
			<b1> enjoyed this lab in particular because of it. I also like the formatting in my .js
				<b2> file.
