  </div>
  <div> <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The main challenge of this lab was to create a function in lab.js that would scramble thw words typed by the user.</p>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div> <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The biggest problem I encountered in this lab was understanding the function on a micro level. The code I had to type used other built-in functions that required an understanding of their individual properties.</p>
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div> <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The result is pretty cool. I like how the project asks for direct user enaggement and can give any number of ifferent responses.</p>
