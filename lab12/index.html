  <h3>Lab 12 - Conditionals<h3>
  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The main challenge of this lab was creating an input field and associated button that will sort people into one of four Hogwarts Houses based on their input..</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> This lab was easy aside form using jQuery. Lab 10 was very similar to this, though jQuery was not a factor then. After some experimentation everything went fairly smoothly.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The lab came out exactly as planned, though the trials I went trhough to get there yielded some funny results. Changing the house names into arbritrary playground insults was particularly fun.</p>
    </h2>
  <h1>Welcome to Hogwarts</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> Prepare to be sorted into your house and the inevitable accompanying disappointment.</p>
    </h2>
