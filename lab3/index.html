	<h2>
	<p> The main focus of this lab was to gain familiarity with file strcutures
		<b1> and referencing other files within that structure.
	</p></h2></div>
	<div id="titles"> <h1>Challenges<h1>
	<h2>
	<p> The biggest hurdle was learning about file directories. I already have
		<b1> some experience with this, but I found that even when the text was
		<b2> correct it wouldn't open the right file. This was because the first
		<b3> folder in the text was one already shared. Aside from that the only
		<b4> difficulties involved getting used to CSS.
