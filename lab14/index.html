  <h3>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies<h3>
  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The challenge of this lab was to find any console errors in my previous labs and iron them out.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> My main issue came from... nothing! All of my previous labs function exactly as intended!</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>

      <p> I guess here I can reflect on my satisfaction for all of the previous labs. I think I did well on all of them. At this point it's probably too late to edit my overall css style as I said I would, but that's pretty minor. I'm glad with my work.</p>
