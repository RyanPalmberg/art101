  <h3>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web<h3>

  <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The challenge of this lab was to show text from my JS file on my webpage.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> The actual means of producing the code and getting it on my webpage wasn't the hardest thing I have had to code. The main ossue came from reading the instructions. I was lost for so much of this lab and it wasn't aided by the fact there were no images in the assignment page.</p>
    </h2>

  <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> I am unsure if I did the assignment correctly. Thus, I am a bit unsure of the quality of my work. I am satisfied with the effort, though I cannot speak on the product.</p>
